# Exploits Ported to Metasploit
Here is a collection of Buffer Overflows (Stack &amp; SEH) I reproduced in Python and finally ported in Metasploit modules.
Target is Windows XP SP3 32 bit.

Particularly, 'pcman_ftp_2.0.7_CDUP_exploit.rb' exploits a vulnerability
not already reported on www.exploit-db.com.
